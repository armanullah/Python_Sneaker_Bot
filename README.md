# Python_Sneaker_Bot

This is a basic bot that automates the checkout process for a specific shoe of your choosing and autofills the information you would like. This is very basic version and will need to be optimized. 

Information that will be changed will include:
1. the User information in the textfields throughout the code to match your own information. 
2. The URL link for your specific shoe. 
3. The amount of time you rest in between pages will vary and can be shortened in order
